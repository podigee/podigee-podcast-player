# Podigee Podcast Player - Configuration

The player is either configured via a JavaScript object present in the same HTML tree as the `<script>` tag or by providing an URL to a JSON configuration file.

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "episode": {
    "media": {"mp3": "https://example.com/episode-1.mp3"},
    "title": "Transcript Test"
  }
}
```

## Configuration options

The configuration passed into the player either as a Javascript Object or as a JSON file has the following options:

### General options

`options.theme` - The name of the theme to use (defaults to `default`)

`options.sslProxy` - URI of an application capable of proxying non-SSL requests

`options.startPanel` - The name of the panel which should be opened on start

### Podcast

`podcast` - An object containing information about the podcast

`podcast.feed` - The podcast's feed address

### Episode

`episode` - An object containing information about the episode

`episode.title` - The episode title

`episode.subtitle` - The episode subtitle

`episode.description` - The episode description / shownotes

`episode.coverUrl` - An URL pointing to the episode cover

`episode.url` - An URL pointing the episode webpage

`episode.embedCode` - This overrides the default embed code (normally you don't need this)

`episode.media` - An object containing media files for an episode (see below)

`episode.chaptermarks` - An object containing chaptermark information (see below)

`episode.transcript` - An URL where the player can fetch a WebVTT transcript file for this episode. If the WebVTT file is on another domain as the player, the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) applies. You'll need to [enable CORS](http://enable-cors.org/) in order to do so.

### Media

`episode.media` - This is an object containing one or more mappings of audio format to url. For example:

`episode.media.opus` - The URL to play the OPUS version of the episode
`episode.media.m4a` - The URL to play the AAC version of the episode
`episode.media.mp3` - The URL to play the MP3 version of the episode
`episode.media.ogg` - The URL to play the Ogg vorbis version of the episode

(This is also the order in which the player will try to play the files)

### Chaptermarks

`episode.chaptermarks` - This is an object containing zero or more chaptermarks in the following format:

`episode.chaptermarks[0].start` - Starting time of the chapter as timestring (e.g. 00:05:26)

`episode.chaptermarks[0].title` - Title of the chapter

`episode.chaptermarks[0].image` - URL to a chapter image

`episode.chaptermarks[0].href` - URL to an external page

### Extension options

`extensions` - An object containing configuration for different extensions

At the moment extensions only have one option to disable them. The keys for the different extensions are:

`extensions.Chaptermarks`

`extensions.Download`

`extensions.EpisodeInfo`

`extensions.Playlist`

`extensions.Share`

`extensions.SubscribeBar`

`extensions.Transcript`
